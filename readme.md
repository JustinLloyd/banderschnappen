## Overview

The Banderschnappen project allows you to generate diverse and immersive role-playing scenarios in various environments 
such as wilderness, abandoned outposts, villages, dungeons, and more. Each environment has multiple zones, with each zone 
containing an array of unique locations. 

By leveraging the AI capabilities of OpenAI's ChatGPT, Banderschnappen ensures that each scenario is unpredictable and full 
of potential for fun and exciting RPG experiences. The Banderschnappen software acts as the DM for a group of 1 to 4 human
players to role play as a group in the world of D&D and is also ideally suited to solo play.

## Features
